SleepTracker
============

Simple app that helps you collect information about your sleep. It lets you track start time, end time, quality, and time slept.

This is the toy app for Lesson 7 of the [Android App Development in Kotlin] course on Udacity.

This app demonstrates the following views and techniques:
- Room database, DAO, and Coroutines
- Transformation map
- Data Binding in XML files
- ViewModel Factory
- Using Backing Properties to protect MutableLiveData
- Observable state LiveData variables to trigger navigation

I've also tried to add testing and hilt for dependency injection.
